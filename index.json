Eumeration kicks off with an Nmap scan revealing SSH and HTTP services. The HTTP service runs Request Tracker 4.4.4, known for an information disclosure vulnerability via user enumeration. Default credentials for ‘root’ are found. Accessing the admin panel discloses a user’s password, ‘Welcome2023!’.\nUsing SSH with found credentials grants access to an Ubuntu system. A Keepass database and program dump are discovered, leading to the recovery of the master password ‘rødgrød med fløde’ (Danish dessert), granting access to the Keepass database. A Putty PPK file is found and converted to an RSA key, allowing SSH access as ‘root.’ This progression results in successful completion of the challenge.\nInitial Recon # We verify our connection with the machine, in case it does not respond, Check your VPN file:\n❯ ping -c 1 10.10.11.227 PING 10.10.11.227 (10.10.11.227) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 10.10.11.227: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=140 ms --- 10.10.11.227 ping statistics --- 1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 140.045/140.045/140.045/0.000 ms we start our scanning with nmap:\n\u0026gt; sudo nmap -sS --open -p- --min-rate 5000 -n -Pn -v 10.10.11.227 -oG nmapScan PORT STATE SERVICE 22/tcp open ssh 80/tcp open http Let\u0026rsquo;s perform a more in-depth scan:\nnmap -sVC -p22,80 10.10.11.227 -oN ports PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) | ssh-hostkey: | 256 35:39:d4:39:40:4b:1f:61:86:dd:7c:37:bb:4b:98:9e (ECDSA) |_ 256 1a:e9:72:be:8b:b1:05:d5:ef:fe:dd:80:d8:ef:c0:66 (ED25519) 80/tcp open http nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu) |_http-server-header: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu) |_http-title: Site doesn\u0026#39;t have a title (text/html).

The first being the recently opened tickets page. which discloses an issue one of the users is having. They are saying they have a crash dump in their home directory to help the admins debug their issues with keepass. This is very interesting information giving us a target to go after once we have access to the system.\nSecondly when checking out the users panel of the application we could see that the same user we noticed before in the ticket had a note on her profile. This note mentioned their default starters password.

Possible usernames can be derived from employee full names listed on the website. With these usernames, an ASREPRoasting attack can be performed, which results in hash for an account that doesn\u0026amp;amp;#039;t require Kerberos pre-authentication.\nThis hash can be subjected to an offline brute force attack, in order to recover the plaintext password for a user that is able to WinRM to the box. Running WinPEAS reveals that another system user has been configured to automatically login and it identifies their password. This second user also has Windows remote management permissions. BloodHound reveals that this user has the DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All extended right, which allows them to dump password hashes from the Domain Controller in a DCSync attack.

In this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll delve into the advanced aspects of LFI and Path Traversal, exploring real-world examples and learning how to effectively mitigate these risks.\nUnderstanding Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Path Traversal: # Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to include files from the server\u0026rsquo;s file system. Path Traversal, on the other hand, involves manipulating file paths to access files outside the web root directory. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to disclose sensitive information, execute arbitrary code, or even compromise the entire system.\nExploring Advanced LFI and Path Traversal Techniques: # Directory Traversal Attack: In this scenario, the attacker manipulates input parameters to traverse directories and access files outside the web root directory. For example, by appending \u0026ldquo;../\u0026rdquo; to a file path, the attacker can navigate to parent directories and access sensitive files.\nNull Byte Injection: Null byte injection exploits the use of null terminators in file paths to bypass security measures. By appending a null byte (%00) to the end of a file path, the attacker can truncate the path and access files that would otherwise be restricted.\nDouble Encoding: Double encoding involves encoding special characters multiple times to bypass input validation mechanisms. For instance, the attacker may encode \u0026ldquo;../\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;%252e%252e%252f\u0026rdquo; to bypass filters and execute a directory traversal attack.\nReal-World Examples: # Consider a web application vulnerable to LFI and Path Traversal. The attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to access sensitive configuration files, such as \u0026ldquo;/etc/passwd\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;/etc/shadow\u0026rdquo;, leading to unauthorized access to user credentials.\nMitigating LFI and Path Traversal: # To mitigate LFI and Path Traversal vulnerabilities, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to implement robust input validation and access controls:\nSanitize user input to prevent directory traversal attacks. Implement proper file path validation to restrict access to authorized directories. Use secure coding practices, such as parameterized queries and output encoding, to prevent injection attacks. Regularly update and patch web servers and applications to address known vulnerabilities. ##Conclusion: Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Path Traversal are serious security risks that require careful attention and mitigation strategies. By understanding the advanced techniques used by attackers and implementing effective security measures, organizations can protect their web applications and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
